# ProjectTwoNode
Project 2/3 for Node.js, Express, RESTful APIs
This project incorporates a lot. It shows MVM architecture, Express.js, custom built RESTful APIs, HTTP requests, Postman tested requests, and MongDB at play. I can expand on these by adding edge case sceraios that show my skills I learned in the topics mentioned. I can also add additional methods to show more functionality (ex: Mongoose provides a ton of built in methods for MongoDB integration. I can use more of these to further show my knowledge in the subject).
